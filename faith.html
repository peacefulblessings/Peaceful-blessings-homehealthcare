    <h2>Serving With Purpose</h2>
    <p>Our care is rooted in prayer, compassion, and the belief that God calls us to serve with humility and love. We honor each individual as created with purpose and value, and we approach caregiving with reverence—especially during end‑of‑life transitions. We support not only physical needs, but emotional and spiritual well‑being, creating a peaceful environment where families feel supported and never alone.</p>
